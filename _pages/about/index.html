<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi, I’m Kai — a PhD student in the [Operations, Information and Decisions Department][https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu] at the [Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania][https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/], and an affiliate of the [Centre for Causal Inference][https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/center-of-excellence/cci/] in Penn Biostatistics. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dean Knox][https://dcknox.github.io].</p> <p>I study <strong>causal inference</strong> in theory and application. My research broadly follows two streams: (i) developing (algorithmic) partial identification strategies which permit causal inferences in challenging data environments; (ii) applying modern causal inference techniques to investigate fairness in social and institutional settings, e.g. police enforcement and schooling.</p> <p>I grew up in Birmingham, UK (but support Arsenal FC). Before joining Penn, I obtained a master’s degree in mathematics from [Imperial College London][https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/], during which I was fortunate to spend a year studying abroad at the [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne][https://www.epfl.ch/en/] in Switzerland.</p> <p>When not in the office, you’ll find me: at the cinema, playing <strong>foot</strong>ball or badminton, reading or watching some dystopian science-fiction.</p> </body></html>
